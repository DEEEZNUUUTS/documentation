      <li>Choose your hero! A player needs someone to have something, so decide who you want to main first! </li>
      <li>Be wary of your laning. In the game, you will have the side lanes formatted for the first 3:40 minutes of the game.</li>
      <li>Push your lane! Since the goal of the game is to destroy the enemy's base, you should destroy the turrets that are blocking your way.</li>

</li>
      <li>Communicate! Since teamwork relies on help, tell them if you want them as a backup or to retreat when needed.</li>
